The ros components built in here are to be used for working with the DaVinci.

camera-delay: 
	- This adds an amount of delay onto the image streams in rostopic /stereo/right/image_raw and /stereo/left/image_raw
	- The output delay stream will be in rostopic /stereo/right_delay/image_raw and /stereo/left_delay/image_raw
To run it:
	- type in terminal: ~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/camera-delay/camera-delay -d <delay-in-ms> -b <-buffer-size>
	- default buffer size is 20
